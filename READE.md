I am Aspiring to become a full stack Web Application Developer.

I love to code, I find it inspiring to watch my code come alive and see it do great things.

I think about code while I am coding, I dream about coding, and when I wake up! I code some more.

My purpose for building my portfolio site is to highlight what I was able to achieve by using HTML and CSS code, with supporting jQuery and JavaScript's to do a little menu morphing.

You will notice simple colour palette theme, the dark blue background is used to focus on features that are available to the reader. There are also shades of light blue with grey trimmings to highlight hover features.

I incorporated spinning icons to catch the eye, headings that slide and fade from one screen to the other, and menus that morph into a hamburger icon to declutter the screen with links to twitter and my github repositories.

This site is responsive, objects on screen shift as the screen is resized, and it is mobile and disability friendly.

My long term goal is to attract continual employment and maybe even promote my personal brand.

The target audience is aimed at perspective employers looking for web app developers or to possibly help others to complete a task.
