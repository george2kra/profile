    <p class="profile">
      A Melbournian since the age of 1, my parents migrated from
      Macedonia to Australia in 1966.
      Taking on the Melbourne culture I grew up watching football,
      cricket, tennis, eating meat pies and fish and chips with friends.

      In my late teens after high school I started my long career in
      I.T. as a tape and printer jockey within an insurance computer
      department.

      <br><br>
      Soon afterwards I was promoted as an Operations Analyst where I
      provisioned resources to ensure a successful overnight batch schedule.
      This was where I developed a knack for coding when I had a need to
      code scripts in CList, Rexx, Korn, and Bash to automate manual processes.

      <br><br>

      My interests lead me to database administration, where I was more
      invovled in projects, liasing with customers organizing their database
      and table structures, and tuning their SQL codes.

      <br><br>
      Further opportunities took me to Backup and Storage management,
      dealing with data backups and recovery strategies, provisoning storage,
      volume replication, disk encryption, and disaster recovery planning.

      <br><br>
      Due to staff restructuring I was made redundant and decided to take
      on a coding passion which brought me to the Coder Factory Acedemy
      software development course that includes Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS,
      Javascripts, and React in order to become an accomplished
      full stack developer.

      Outside of IT I love the AFL sport where I get to go to games with
      friends and enjoy the pace of the match especially when Geelong wins.
      I am also an avid foodie fan, I particularly enjoy Thai cuisines and
      street festivals, but most of all I love the chase of finding the
      next great eat.
